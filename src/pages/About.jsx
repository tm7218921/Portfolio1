      <p>
      I’m Tanmay, someone who enjoys working at the intersection of strategy, design, and new technology.
      I’m currently pursuing engineering in AI & Data Science at Datta Meghe College (CGPA: 7.32, 2022–2026).
      I’ve worked on projects ranging from real-time AI systems to scalable web applications, and I love solving challenging problems through clean code and collaborative, impact-driven work.
